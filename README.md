# Bookmark Manager

A customisable bookmark manager made in Python made by Raiyaxi Ziaoi AKA DadaLittleOne
The bookmark.txt file contains sample websites and more can be added via the application itself. It is also automatically formatted by the program when you use its in-built bookmark adder.

This project was mostly created for fun but was also created on the basis that some browsers may use bookmarks to track us. Note: I am a beginner to Python so feel free to clone this repository to edit and optimise the code.
